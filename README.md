Framework template for Atom, An MVC microframework for PHP. Quite heavily inspired by Laravel

## Description

Atom is designed to map most of the basic features of Laravel Framework while still maintaining compact bundle size and runtime speed. Because of this we have tried to implement most features internally as much as possible and only resort to third party libraries where its absolutely necessary.

* Console Commands using Artisan-Like Driver (Custom Commands Supported)

* Models (with fluent ORM query builder similar to eloquent)
* Fluent Database Query Builder
* Middlewares
* Service Providers
* Bladelike (using Bladeone) or Twiglike Templating Engine
* Storage Class with support for (public, local, s3, google, ftp and ftps filesystems)
* File Class for file operations
* Cache with support for (database, file, redis, array, apc, dynamodb, memcached and octane cache drivers)
* Facade System
* Job Runner
* Scheduler
* Mail Sender with support for (sendmail, smtp, sendgrid, aws-sqs and other mail drivers)
* DB Migrations and Seeds support (using phinx)
